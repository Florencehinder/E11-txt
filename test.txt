Genes, Ecology and Evolution 
  Humans live in large and extensive societies and spend much of their time interacting socially. Likewise, most other animals also interact socially. Social behaviour i s  a  s o u r c e  o f  c o n s t a n t  f a s c i n a ti o n  t o  b i o l o gi s t s  a n d  psychologists of many disciplines; from behavioural ecology to comparative biology and sociobiology. Th  e 
two major approaches used to study social behaviour involve either the mechanism of behaviour – where it has come from and how it has evolved – or the func-tion of the behaviour studied. Featuring guest contri-butions from leaders in the fi  eld, this book presents 
both theoretical foundations and recent advances to give a truly multidiscplinary overview of social behaviour for advanced undergraduate and gradu-ate students. Topics include aggression, communica-tion, group living, sexual behaviour and cooperative breeding. With examples ranging from bacteria to social mammals and humans, a variety of research tools are used, including candidate gene approaches, quantitative genetics, neuroendocrine studies, cost–benefi  t and phylogenetic analyses, and evolutionary 
game theory.   Tamás Székely   is an evolutionary biologist with a 
main research interest in breeding- system evolu-tion. Most of his work uses birds as model organisms, studied mostly through fi  eld work but also with the 
use of mathematical modelling and phylogenetic analyses to dissect behaviour. He has co-edited four books, including one on sex, size and gender roles. He is Professor of Biodiversity at the University of Bath, and was recently awarded a research fellowship by the Leverhulme Trust. He has also been a visiting fel-low at Harvard University.   Allen J. Moore   is an evolutionary biologist whose 
research interests include quantitative genetic stud-ies of behaviour and morphology, the development of behaviour, theoretical investigations of evolu-tion, and behavioural ecology. He is Professor of Evolutionary Genetics at the University of Exeter, as well as head of school and director of the university’s Centre for Ecology and Conservation. He is a former secretary of the Society for the Study of Evolution, and is currently editor-in-chief of the  Journal of 
Evolutionary Biology  . 
  Jan Komdeur   has a strong reputation in experi-
mental evolutionary ecology. He established the Seychelles warbler as a model system, and his many long-standing international collaborations with leading biologists connect aspects of behav-ioural ecology, population genetics and theoretical modelling. He has published many papers in inter-national journals, serves on several editorial boards, and has received a number of prestigious inter-national awards and grants. He is Professor of Avian Evolutionary Ecology at the University of Groningen and Director of the Top Master’s programme in evo-lutionary ecology.
